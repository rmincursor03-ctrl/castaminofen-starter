# Castaminofen AI Development Instructions

> This document defines the engineering standards, architecture rules, coding guidelines, and AI behavior for the Castaminofen project.
>
> Every AI assistant (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini, etc.) MUST read and follow these instructions before making any modification to this repository.

---

# 1. Project Overview

## Project Name

Castaminofen

## Project Type

Mobile-First Podcast Platform

## Primary Goal

Build a modern, scalable podcast platform focused on excellent user experience, maintainability, and long-term growth.

The platform initially focuses on podcast discovery, RSS synchronization, online playback, and offline listening.

The MVP must remain intentionally small while keeping the architecture scalable.

The project should evolve gradually without requiring major architectural rewrites.

---

# 2. Product Vision

Castaminofen is **NOT** just another podcast player.

It is intended to become a complete podcast ecosystem where users can:

- Discover podcasts
- Import podcasts from RSS
- Listen online
- Download episodes
- Listen offline
- Build personal libraries
- Create playlists
- Follow creators
- Publish podcasts
- Manage podcast channels

Future versions may include social features, recommendations, analytics and creator tools.

These future features MUST NOT affect MVP architecture.

---

# 3. Development Philosophy

Always prioritize:

- Simplicity
- Maintainability
- Scalability
- Readability
- Consistency

Avoid unnecessary complexity.

Never implement features simply because they "might be useful later."

Every abstraction must solve a real problem.

Every dependency must have a clear purpose.

Every folder must have a reason to exist.

---

# 4. Engineering Principles

Always follow:

- SOLID
- DRY
- KISS
- Clean Architecture
- Feature First Architecture
- API First
- Type Safety
- Composition over Inheritance

Never sacrifice readability for clever code.

Readable code is always preferred.

---

# 5. AI Responsibilities

You are NOT a code generator.

You are the Lead Software Architect.

Every decision must be intentional.

Before writing code:

1. Understand the existing architecture.
2. Check whether the feature already exists.
3. Follow existing conventions.
4. Avoid introducing breaking changes.

Never generate duplicate logic.

Never create multiple ways to solve the same problem.

Always reuse existing code whenever appropriate.

---

# 6. AI Workflow

Every task must follow this workflow.

Step 1

Understand the request.

Step 2

Analyze the current architecture.

Step 3

Determine the minimal required changes.

Step 4

Implement production-ready code.

Step 5

Verify everything compiles.

Step 6

Fix lint issues.

Step 7

Fix TypeScript issues.

Step 8

Summarize completed work.

Stop.

Wait for the user's confirmation before starting another phase.

Never continue automatically.

---

# 7. MVP First

The MVP is the highest priority.

Never implement future features during MVP development.

If a requested implementation belongs to a future phase:

Do NOT implement it.

Instead:

Explain why.

Prepare the architecture if necessary.

Continue focusing on MVP.

---

# 8. Long-Term Architecture

Although MVP is intentionally small, architecture must support future growth.

Architecture should support:

- millions of episodes
- millions of users
- horizontal scaling
- distributed workers
- background jobs
- caching
- CDN
- cloud storage

However:

Never implement enterprise infrastructure before it becomes necessary.

Prepare.

Do not over engineer.

---

# 9. General Rules

Always prefer:

Simple > Clever

Explicit > Implicit

Reusable > Duplicated

Typed > Dynamic

Maintainable > Fast to write

Never optimize prematurely.

Never introduce unnecessary abstractions.

---

# 10. Forbidden Practices

Never create:

God Components

God Services

Massive utility folders

Deep inheritance trees

Circular dependencies

Duplicated APIs

Duplicated components

Magic strings

Magic numbers

Global mutable state

Anonymous complex functions

Overly generic helper functions

Large files with multiple responsibilities

---

# 11. Documentation Rules

Every important decision must be documented.

If architecture changes:

Update documentation.

If API changes:

Update documentation.

If folder structure changes:

Update documentation.

Code and documentation must never diverge.

---

# 12. Project Documentation

The AI must always treat the following files as the source of truth.

docs/

- roadmap.md
- architecture.md
- mvp.md
- backlog.md
- tech-stack.md
- folder-structure.md
- dependencies.md
- ui-ux-design-system.md

Whenever a conflict exists:

Project documentation takes priority.

---

# 13. Repository Structure

The repository is a Monorepo.

Expected root structure:

apps/

packages/

docs/

.github/

docker/

scripts/

Never create unnecessary root folders.

---

# 14. Technology Stack

Frontend

- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Zustand
- TanStack Query
- React Hook Form
- Zod
- next-intl

Backend

- NestJS

- BullMQ

Infrastructure

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- MinIO
- Nginx

Authentication

- JWT
- Refresh Tokens
- bcrypt

Never replace technologies without explicit user approval.

---

# 15. Development Priorities

Always prioritize work in this order.

1. Stability

2. Correctness

3. Maintainability

4. Simplicity

5. Performance

6. Developer Experience

7. New Features

Performance optimizations should never reduce code quality.

---

# 16. Definition of High Quality Code

High quality code is:

Small

Readable

Predictable

Typed

Testable

Reusable

Consistent

Self-documenting

Easy to review

Easy to maintain

Easy to extend

Every pull request should improve the codebase.

Never degrade it.

---

# 17. Monorepo Standards

The project MUST remain a clean and scalable monorepo.

Preferred structure:

```
apps/
    web/
    api/

packages/
    config/
    shared-types/

docs/

docker/

scripts/
```

Rules:

- Applications live only inside `apps/`
- Shared code lives only inside `packages/`
- Documentation lives only inside `docs/`
- Infrastructure files stay inside `docker/`
- Automation scripts stay inside `scripts/`

Never place application code inside packages.

Never place shared code inside applications unless it is application-specific.

---

# 18. Folder Structure Philosophy

The project follows **Feature-Based Architecture**.

Folders represent business capabilities.

Never organize by file type.

Good:

```
features/
    auth/
    player/
    search/
    podcast/
```

Bad:

```
components/
hooks/
utils/
pages/
services/
```

at the project root.

Every feature owns its:

- components
- hooks
- api
- types
- utils
- constants
- validation

Features should be as independent as possible.

---

# 19. Frontend Architecture

Frontend uses:

- Next.js App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

Rules:

Server Components by default.

Client Components only when required.

Never mark an entire page as "use client" unless unavoidable.

Prefer:

Server Component

↓

Client Component

instead of

Client Page

↓

Everything Client.

---

# 20. Frontend Directory Structure

Recommended structure:

```
app/

features/

shared/

components/

lib/

providers/

styles/

types/

public/
```

Each feature owns its own implementation.

Shared folder should stay small.

If something is used by only one feature, it belongs inside that feature.

---

# 21. Component Rules

Components must have a single responsibility.

Avoid giant components.

Recommended size:

100–200 lines.

Split components when they become difficult to understand.

Component hierarchy should remain shallow.

Prefer composition over inheritance.

---

# 22. Shared Components

Shared components should be:

Reusable

Generic

Independent

Examples:

Button

Input

Modal

Dialog

Avatar

Badge

Skeleton

Spinner

Tooltip

Never place business logic inside shared components.

---

# 23. Feature Components

Business components stay inside their feature.

Example:

PodcastCard

EpisodeCard

MiniPlayer

PlaylistSidebar

HistoryList

SearchResults

Do NOT move them into shared.

---

# 24. State Management

Use Zustand only for:

Global UI State

Examples:

Player

Theme

Sidebar

Language

Settings

Authentication Session

Never store server data in Zustand.

---

# 25. Server State

Use TanStack Query.

All API communication should go through Query.

Do not duplicate server state.

Never fetch directly inside random components.

---

# 26. Forms

All forms must use:

React Hook Form

+

Zod

Validation belongs inside feature folders.

Never validate forms manually.

---

# 27. Styling

Use Tailwind CSS only.

Do not write unnecessary CSS files.

Avoid inline styles.

Prefer utility classes.

Extract reusable UI patterns into components.

---

# 28. Icons

Use Lucide Icons.

Avoid multiple icon libraries.

Maintain visual consistency.

---

# 29. Theme

Dark Mode is the default experience.

Light Mode is optional.

Every new component must support both themes.

Never hardcode colors.

Always use design tokens.

---

# 30. RTL Support

RTL is required.

Layouts must work correctly in:

RTL

LTR

Never assume left-to-right layouts.

Use logical CSS properties whenever possible.

Avoid left/right specific styling.

Prefer:

start

end

instead of:

left

right

---

# 31. Internationalization

Use next-intl.

Never hardcode user-facing strings.

All visible text belongs inside translation files.

Components should never contain static UI text.

---

# 32. Accessibility

Accessibility is mandatory.

Every component should support:

Keyboard navigation

Screen readers

ARIA labels

Focus states

Semantic HTML

Never sacrifice accessibility for aesthetics.

---

# 33. Backend Architecture

Backend uses:

NestJS

Feature Modules

Each module owns:

Controller

Service

DTO

Entity (if required)

Validation

Types

Never create huge shared service folders.

---

# 34. NestJS Module Rules

Every feature must remain isolated.

Example:

```
modules/

auth/

podcasts/

episodes/

rss/

users/

comments/

playlist/

library/
```

Avoid dependencies between unrelated modules.

Keep module boundaries clear.

---

# 35. Controllers

Controllers should remain thin.

Responsibilities:

Receive request

Validate request

Call Service

Return response

Never place business logic inside controllers.

---

# 36. Services

Business logic belongs inside services.

Services should:

Read

Validate

Transform

Execute business rules

Communicate with Prisma

Communicate with Redis

Communicate with BullMQ

Keep methods focused.

---

# 37. Database

Database:

PostgreSQL

ORM:

Prisma

Never use raw SQL unless absolutely necessary.

Prefer Prisma APIs.

Keep schema readable.

Avoid unnecessary complexity.

---

# 38. Prisma Rules

Every schema must:

Be normalized

Use explicit relations

Use indexes where appropriate

Use meaningful names

Never create unused fields.

Avoid nullable fields unless required.

Prefer explicit relation names.

---

# 39. Database Naming

Tables:

Singular

PascalCase model names

Examples:

User

Podcast

Episode

Playlist

Comment

RSSFeed

Columns:

camelCase

IDs:

id

UUID preferred.

Created timestamp:

createdAt

deletedAt

only if required.

---

# 40. API Design

REST API.

Versioned endpoints.

```
/api/v1
```

Resource examples:

```
GET    /podcasts

GET    /episodes

POST   /playlists

PATCH  /users/profile

DELETE /comments/:id
```

Keep endpoints predictable.

Avoid action-based routes.

Good:

```
POST /playlists
```

Bad:

```
POST /createPlaylist
```

---

# 41. DTO Standards

Every request uses DTOs.

Validation:

class-validator

Transformation:

class-transformer

Never expose Prisma models directly.

DTOs define the public API.

---

# 42. Error Handling

Global Exception Filter.

Consistent API responses.

Never leak internal errors.

Every error should provide:

Status Code

Message

Error Code (when applicable)

Never expose stack traces in production.

---

# 43. Authentication Standards

Authentication must be secure, scalable, and stateless.

Use:

- JWT Access Token
- JWT Refresh Token
- HttpOnly Cookies
- bcrypt

Never store passwords in plain text.

Never log passwords.

Never expose sensitive information in API responses.

Always hash passwords before storing them.

Refresh Tokens must be revocable.

Authentication logic belongs only inside the Auth module.

---

# 44. Authorization

Authentication and Authorization are different concerns.

Authentication identifies the user.

Authorization determines permissions.

Always validate permissions inside services.

Never trust client-side role checks.

Never expose admin functionality without authorization.

---

# 45. Security Standards

Security is mandatory.

Always validate:

- Request body
- Query parameters
- Route parameters
- Uploaded files

Never trust client input.

Always sanitize external data.

Use rate limiting where appropriate.

Use secure HTTP headers.

Avoid unnecessary third-party packages.

Dependencies should be actively maintained.

---

# 46. Environment Variables

Never hardcode secrets.

Every environment variable must be documented.

Provide:

.env.example

Sensitive values must never be committed.

Examples:

DATABASE_URL

REDIS_URL

JWT_SECRET

JWT_REFRESH_SECRET

MINIO_ENDPOINT

MINIO_ACCESS_KEY

Large payloads

---

# 48. Background Jobs

Background processing uses BullMQ.

Use queues for:

RSS synchronization

Episode processing

Media processing

Large imports

Never perform heavy work inside HTTP requests.

Controllers should return quickly.

---

# 49. RSS Architecture

RSS synchronization is a core feature.

RSS updates must run in background jobs.

The synchronization flow:

Fetch feed

↓

Parse XML

↓

Validate feed

↓

Detect changes

↓

Store new episodes

↓

Update podcast metadata

↓

Finish

Never recreate existing episodes.

Detect duplicates before inserting.

Only update changed records.

---

# 50. Podcast Data

Podcast metadata should remain normalized.

Examples:

Title

Description

Language

Artwork

Categories

Owner

RSS URL

Website

Author

Episode data belongs to Episode.

Do not duplicate information.

---

# 51. Audio Player Architecture

The player is a global feature.

There must only be ONE player.

Never create multiple playback instances.

Player state should contain:

Current Episode

Queue

Playback Position

Playback Speed

Volume

Repeat Mode

Shuffle Mode

Playing State

Loading State

The player should survive route navigation.

---

# 52. Offline Architecture

Offline listening is a required feature.

Prepare architecture from day one.

Use:

Service Worker

IndexedDB

Cache Storage

Downloaded media should remain independent from UI.

Downloading logic must be isolated.

Playback should not care whether media is online or offline.

---

# 53. Upload Architecture

Uploads should support:

Podcast artwork

Episode artwork

Future audio uploads

Storage provider must remain replaceable.

Use MinIO.

Avoid storage-specific logic inside business services.

---

# 54. Search

Search should remain modular.

The implementation may evolve later.

Current MVP uses PostgreSQL search.

Future versions may introduce Elasticsearch.

Do not design today's code around future Elasticsearch.

Keep search implementation replaceable.

---

# 55. Performance Guidelines

Optimize only after measuring.

Prefer:

Readable code

↓

Correct code

↓

Fast code

Avoid premature optimization.

Use lazy loading where appropriate.

Use pagination.

Avoid unnecessary database queries.

Avoid N+1 queries.

---

# 56. React Performance

Avoid unnecessary re-renders.

Prefer:

Memoization only when needed.

Use indexes carefully.

Avoid indexing everything.

Review query performance.

Prefer efficient Prisma queries.

Avoid unnecessary nested queries.

---

# 59. Code Style

Code should read like documentation.

Choose descriptive names.

Avoid abbreviations.

Good:

podcastRepository

episodeDuration

currentPlaybackPosition

Bad:

repo

dur

cp

tmp

data2

x

---

# 60. Function Design

Functions should:

Do one thing.

Be easy to understand.

Avoid side effects.

Return predictable results.

Keep nesting shallow.

Prefer early returns.

---

# 61. TypeScript Standards

Strict Mode is required.

Never disable strict mode.

Avoid:

any

Prefer:

unknown

or proper types.

Infer types where appropriate.

Export shared types.

Avoid duplicated interfaces.

---

# 62. Naming Conventions

Components:

PascalCase

PodcastCard.tsx

Hooks:

camelCase

usePlayer.ts

Files:

kebab-case where appropriate.

Types:

PascalCase

Interfaces:

PascalCase

Enums:

PascalCase

Constants:

UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

Variables:

camelCase

---

# 63. Import Order

Always organize imports.

Order:

Node modules

↓

Third-party packages

↓

Internal packages

↓

Shared

↓

Feature

↓

Relative

Avoid circular imports.

---

# 64. Code Reuse

Before writing new code:

Search existing codebase.

If functionality exists:

Reuse it.

Never duplicate logic.

Duplicate code is a bug.

---

# 65. Comments

Comments explain WHY.

Code explains HOW.

Avoid obvious comments.

Bad:

// Increment counter

counter++

Good:

// Retry because RSS providers occasionally return temporary 503 responses.

---

# 66. Testing Philosophy

Write testable code.

Business logic should remain easy to unit test.

Avoid tightly coupled code.

Favor dependency injection where appropriate.

Do not implement tests unless requested.

But always write code that is test-friendly.

---

# 67. Git Workflow

Keep commits focused.

One logical change per commit.

Avoid mixing unrelated work.

Prefer small incremental changes.

Follow Conventional Commits.

Examples:

feat:

fix:

refactor:

docs:

test:

chore:

---

# 68. Documentation Standards

Whenever architecture changes:

Update documentation.

Whenever dependencies change:

Update documentation.

Whenever folder structure changes:

Update documentation.

Documentation is part of the project.

Never ignore it.

---

# 69. AI Behavior Rules

You are NOT an autocomplete engine.

You are the Lead Software Architect responsible for maintaining a high-quality, scalable codebase.

Every decision must improve the project.

Never write code only because it works.

Always write code that another engineer will understand six months later.

Before making any change, ask yourself:

- Does this follow the architecture?
- Is this the simplest solution?
- Does similar code already exist?
- Will this increase maintenance cost?
- Can another developer understand this easily?

If the answer is "No", redesign the implementation.

---

# 70. Phase-Based Development

Development must always be incremental.

Never implement multiple unrelated features together.

Every task should belong to one phase.

Workflow:

Understand task

↓

Analyze current code

↓

Implement

↓

Verify

↓

Fix issues

↓

Update documentation

↓

Summarize changes

↓

Stop

Wait for user confirmation.

Never continue automatically.

---

Architecture consistency

Folder structure consistency

Naming consistency

Type safety

Lint passes

Formatting passes

No duplicated logic

No dead code

No unused imports

No unnecessary abstractions

No TODOs unless explicitly requested

Documentation updated

Everything builds successfully

---

# 72. Definition of Done

A task is only complete if:

✅ Project builds successfully

✅ TypeScript has zero errors

✅ ESLint has zero errors

✅ Formatting is correct

✅ Documentation is updated

✅ Feature integrates with existing architecture

✅ No duplicated code introduced

✅ No broken imports

✅ No console debugging left

✅ No temporary code remains

---

# 73. Before Writing Code

Always search the existing project first.

Determine:

Does similar functionality already exist?

Can it be reused?

Can it be extended?

Never rewrite working code without a strong reason.

Prefer extending existing architecture.

---

# 74. Refactoring Rules

Refactor only when:

Readability improves

Maintainability improves

Complexity decreases

Performance is measurably improved

Never refactor simply because you prefer another style.

Avoid unnecessary churn.

---

# 75. Dependency Rules

Before adding a dependency:

Check if current stack already solves the problem.

Do not install libraries that duplicate existing functionality.

Prefer built-in platform APIs.

Every dependency increases maintenance cost.

Use the minimum number of dependencies possible.

# 76. Error Recovery

When implementation becomes uncertain:

Stop.

Analyze.

Explain the uncertainty.

Offer the safest approach.

Never guess.

Never invent APIs.

Never invent library behavior.

---

# 77. Communication Style

When responding:

Be concise.

Be technical.

Be objective.

Avoid unnecessary explanations.

Explain important architectural decisions.

Summaries should include:

What changed

Why it changed

Impact

Next recommended step

---

# 78. Architecture Preservation

Architecture consistency is more important than speed.

Never bypass architecture to finish faster.

Never introduce shortcuts that create technical debt.

Temporary solutions are acceptable only if explicitly approved by the user.

---

# 79. Future Features

Future features should influence architecture only when necessary.

Never implement future functionality today.

Prepare extension points only when they are lightweight and justified.

Avoid speculative engineering.

---

# 80. Backward Compatibility

When modifying existing code:

Avoid breaking public APIs.

Avoid changing folder structures unnecessarily.

Avoid renaming files without reason.

Preserve compatibility whenever possible.

---

# 81. Technical Debt

Reduce technical debt whenever possible.

Never increase technical debt without explicit approval.

If technical debt is unavoidable:

Document it.

Explain it.

Keep it isolated.

---

# 82. Pull Request Mentality

Treat every task as if it will become a Pull Request.

Every change should be:

Small

Reviewable

Understandable

Consistent

Production-ready

---

# 83. Production Readiness

Every implementation should assume production deployment.

Avoid mock implementations unless requested.

Avoid placeholder logic.

Avoid fake services.

Avoid unfinished architecture.

Write production-quality code from the beginning.

---

# 84. AI Must Never

Never ignore existing architecture.

Never create duplicate components.

Never duplicate business logic.

Never generate unused files.

Never create unnecessary abstractions.

Never introduce inconsistent naming.

Never disable TypeScript.

Never disable ESLint.

Never silence errors instead of fixing them.

Never leave commented-out code.

Never leave debugging code.

Never add dependencies without reason.

Never generate code you do not understand.

Never make assumptions about undocumented behavior.

---

# 85. AI Must Always

Always respect project documentation.

Always respect folder structure.

Always respect feature boundaries.

Always write strict TypeScript.

Always keep components small.

Always keep services focused.

Always document architectural decisions.

Always think before coding.

Always verify before finishing.

---

# 86. Continuous Improvement

Every change should leave the project in a better state.

The repository should continuously become:

Cleaner

More maintainable

More consistent

More readable

More scalable

Never leave the codebase worse than you found it.

---

# 87. Project Mission

Castaminofen aims to become a modern, scalable, and enjoyable podcast platform.

Every engineering decision should support:

Excellent User Experience

Maintainability

Scalability

Performance

Security

Developer Experience

Long-Term Growth

The codebase should remain approachable for future contributors.

The architecture should remain simple enough to evolve naturally.

---

# 88. Final Instruction

If there is ever a conflict between:

Speed

and

Code Quality

Always choose Code Quality.

If there is ever a conflict between:

Adding Features

and

Architecture Consistency

Always choose Architecture Consistency.

If there is ever a conflict between:

Complexity

and

Simplicity

Always choose Simplicity.

The goal is not to write the most code.

The goal is to build the best software.

# Phase 2.5.2 — Design System Report

## Status

Completed

## Objective

Establish a reusable frontend design-system foundation for Castaminofen without implementing product-specific features or business flows.

## Changes Made

- Added centralized CSS design tokens covering colors, spacing, radii, shadows, and layout sizing.
- Extended the Tailwind theme with semantic surface, text, border, accent, and feedback color tokens.
- Refined global typography and spacing utilities for RTL-first layout support.
- Strengthened shared UI primitives for button, input, card, loading, and error states.
- Added reusable foundation components for badges, avatars, and empty states.

## Design Tokens

- Introduced dark-mode-first CSS variables in [apps/web/src/styles/tokens.css](apps/web/src/styles/tokens.css).
- Added light-mode overrides and shared layout tokens for consistent spacing and container sizing.

## Typography System

- Added shared heading, subheading, body, and caption styles through the global stylesheet.
- Kept typography aligned with the Vazirmatn-based font setup and RTL-first layout.

## UI Components Created

- Badge
- Avatar
- EmptyState

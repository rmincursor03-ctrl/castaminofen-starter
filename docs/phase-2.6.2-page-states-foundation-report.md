# Phase 2.6.2 — Page States Foundation Report

## Status

Completed

## Objective

Establish reusable frontend page-state patterns for Castaminofen without introducing product features, API integrations, or business logic. The work focused on generic loading, empty, and error foundations that can be reused by existing routes.

## Changes Made

- Added a reusable page-state wrapper component that can render generic loading, empty, and error states.
- Extended the existing loading and error UI primitives to support richer titles, descriptions, and action placeholders while staying visually consistent with the design system.
- Integrated the new state foundation into the existing home, search, library, and profile route placeholders as generic examples only.
- Kept all implementations limited to reusable UI patterns and route structure, without introducing data fetching, business logic, or feature-specific content.

## Loading State Foundation

- Enhanced the shared loading component to support an optional title and message.
- Kept the visual language aligned with the existing Tailwind-based design tokens and RTL layout.

## Empty State Foundation

- Reused the existing empty-state UI primitive through the new shared page-state wrapper.
- Provided a generic title and description structure to support future pages without introducing feature-specific content.

## Error State Foundation

- Expanded the shared error-state primitive to support a title, description, and optional action slot.
- Kept the implementation compatible with a page-level error presentation pattern used by the app shell.

## Route Integration

- Applied the new generic state patterns to the existing placeholder routes:
  - /
  - /search
  - /library
  - /profile

## Dependency Changes

## Build Verification

- pnpm build completed successfully.

## Lint Verification

- pnpm lint completed successfully.

## Scope Compliance Audit

- No product features were added.
- No APIs were connected.
- No business logic was introduced.
- The new states are generic and reusable only.

## Remaining Work

- Future phases can expand these foundations into real feature-specific loading, empty, and error experiences.

## Deferred Items

- Feature-specific empty results, data-fetching states, and business error handling remain intentionally out of scope.

## Next Recommended Phase

- Await review confirmation before proceeding to the next frontend phase.

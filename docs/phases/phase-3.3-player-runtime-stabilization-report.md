# Phase 3.3 — Player Runtime Stabilization & UX Polish

## Objective
Stabilize the existing Player runtime and UI behavior after the queue, repeat, and shuffle MVP work by tightening edge-case handling and improving visible feedback without changing the current architecture.

## Scope
- Harden Player runtime transitions for empty queues, missing audio sources, invalid navigation, and playback errors.
- Improve Player UI messaging for loading, idle, empty, and error states.
- Preserve the existing ownership boundaries of Player, Audio Engine, and Episode.

## Implemented Work
- Added guardrails in the Player runtime to avoid invalid transitions when no queue exists or no audio source is available.
- Made playback start/error paths clearer by surfacing meaningful runtime errors instead of leaving the state ambiguous.
- Updated the compact Player UI so loading states, empty states, and errors are visible without redesigning the layout.
- Added regression tests for missing-audio and empty-queue navigation behavior.

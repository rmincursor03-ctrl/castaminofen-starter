# Phase 2.6.1 — Route & Page Structure Report

## Status

Completed

## Objective

Create a lightweight frontend route and page composition foundation for Castaminofen without introducing product features, API integrations, or business logic.

## Changes Made

- Added structural placeholder pages for the main route areas: home, search, library, and profile.
- Integrated the existing app shell and bottom navigation with real route links.
- Introduced a shared route placeholder composition component to keep page structure consistent and minimal.
- Kept all new pages limited to layout, typography, spacing, and descriptive placeholder content.

## Route Structure

- Home entry at `/`
- Search entry at `/search`
- Library entry at `/library`
- Profile entry at `/profile`

## Page Composition

- Each route renders a minimal placeholder card with a title, short description, and shell-compatible spacing.
- The composition uses the existing design system primitives and app-shell layout without adding feature-specific UI.

## Files Created

- apps/web/src/components/layout/route-placeholder.tsx
- apps/web/src/app/search/page.tsx
- apps/web/src/app/library/page.tsx

## Files Modified

- apps/web/src/app/page.tsx
- apps/web/src/app/profile/page.tsx
- apps/web/src/components/layout/bottom-navigation.tsx

## Dependency Changes

- No new dependencies were added.

## Build Verification

- pnpm build completed successfully.

## Lint Verification

- pnpm lint completed successfully.

## Scope Compliance Audit

- Route links were added only for structural navigation.
- No navigation business logic was introduced.
- No product features were added.
- No APIs were connected.
- No business logic was introduced.
- Pages remain structural placeholders only.

## Remaining Work

- Future phases can expand these routes into real product experiences.

## Deferred Items

## Next Recommended Phase

- Await review confirmation before proceeding to the next frontend phase.
